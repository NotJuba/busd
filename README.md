# busd

A simple D-Bus bus (broker) implementation. This is mainly intended as an easy way to setup CI for any D-Bus using project (including zbus and zbus-based code). Since it's pure Rust, it's much easier to build for Linux, Mac and Windows than other D-Bus brokers.

## Status

Very early development. Only a few things work.
